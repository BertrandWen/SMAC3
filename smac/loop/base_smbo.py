        """The SMBO submits a config-run-request via a RunInfo object. When that config run is
        completed, a RunValue, which contains all the relevant information obtained after running a
        job, is returned. This method incorporates the status of that run into the stats/runhistory
        objects so that other consumers can advance with their task.

        Additionally, it checks for a new incumbent via the intensifier process results,
        which also has the side effect of moving the intensifier to a new state

        Parameters
        ----------
        run_info: RunInfo
            Describes the run (config) from which to process the results.
        result: RunValue
            Contains relevant information regarding the execution of a config.
        time_left: float
            How much time in seconds is left to perform intensification.
        save : bool, optional to True
            Whether the runhistory should be saved.
